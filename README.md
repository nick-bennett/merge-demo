# Nick's weird little math game

This is a game to teach children about addition, as well as problem-solving and simple strategy.

Two players (the user and the computer) take turns adding a number from 1-10 (user-configurable) to a sum that starts at zero; the player that first reaches 100 (also user-configurable) exactly wins the game.
